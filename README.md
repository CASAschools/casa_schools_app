## R Shiny Dashboard

To help schools and communities understand their climate risks, we will create an R Shiny Dashboard to visualize five climate hazards at a school district level. The dashboard will allow users to input an address to view the past, present, and future risks of **Wildfire**, **Flooding**, **Sea Level Rise**, **Extreme Heat**, and **Extreme Precipitation** as well as be given a score to determine their overall risk. Local-level climate adaptation resources will be provided alongside a User Guide to walk users through the dashboard. The dashboard will serve as a resource that allows teachers and students to explore relevant climate change information and to inform lesson plans centered around climate change and the environment. We intend for the dashboard to be accessible to policymakers as well who can use the information provided to inform school-related climate policy.
