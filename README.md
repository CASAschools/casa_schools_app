## R Shiny Dashboard

To help schools and communities understand their climate risks, we will create an R Shiny Dashboard to visualize five climate hazards at a school district level. The dashboard will allow users to input an address to view the past, present, and future risks of **Wildfire**, **Flooding**, **Sea Level Rise**, **Extreme Heat**, and **Extreme Precipitation** as well as be given a score to determine their overall risk. Local-level climate adaptation resources will be provided alongside a User Guide to walk users through the dashboard. The dashboard will serve as a resource that allows teachers and students to explore relevant climate change information and to inform lesson plans centered around climate change and the environment. We intend for the dashboard to be accessible to policymakers as well who can use the information provided to inform school-related climate policy.

### Usage
## Aggregated Hazard Risk
## Explore Your Hazards

This tab features our five interactive climate hazard visualizations:
- **Extreme Heat**
- **Extreme Precipitation**
- **Wildfire**
- **Flooding**
- **Seal-level Rise**

Users can click on each tab at the top of the webpage to explore the risks associated with each climate hazard relative to their location. Users will be able to input their address in a search bar to get the information most relevant to them.
## User Guide
## Resources

Under this tab, users will be given links to additional resources to protect themselves and their communities against climate hazards, as well as short write-ups that provide more information on how to engage their community to address climate change.
