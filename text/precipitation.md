### What does this diagram tell us?


<span style="font-size:18px;">The diagram shows the estimated number of extreme precipitation days the school may experience from 2006 - 2064 in a Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions (yellow) and High Greenhouse Gas Emissions (red) scenario. These scenarios represent two different climate adaptation methods, where under a reduced scenario, emissions may be eliminated through the use of renewable energy sources. Under a high scenario, continuing to burn fossil fuels will contribute to greater greenhouse gas emissions. </span>


### How is extreme precipitation measured?


<span style="font-size:18px;">An extreme precipitation event is a day where precipitation totals measure over 0.7 cumulative inches. This threshold was obtained by taking the 98th percentile of all historic precipitation events from 1961-1990. </span>
