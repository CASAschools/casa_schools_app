### What does this graph tell us?
<span style="font-size:18px;">The graph shows the estimated number of extreme precipitation days the school may experience from 2000 - 2064 in a reduced emissions and high emissions scenario.</span>

### How is extreme precipitation measured?
<span style="font-size:18px;">An extreme precipitation event is a day where precipitation totals measure over 0.7 cumulative inches. This threshold was obtained by taking the 98th percentile of all historic precipitation events from 1961-1990.</span>

<span style="font-size:18px;">Precipitation events are measured under two different scenarios: High Greenhouse Gas Emission and Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions. These scenarios represent two different climate adaptation methods such as continuing to burn fossil fuels or using renewable energy sources.
