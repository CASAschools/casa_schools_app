### What does this graph tell us?
<br>
span style="font-size:18px;">Schools will see an overall increase in extreme precipitation days in a reduced emissions and high emissions scenario.</span>-->

### How is extreme precipitation measured?
<br>
<span style="font-size:18px;">An extreme precipitation event is a day where precipitation totals measure over 0.7 cumulative inches. This threshold was obtained by taking the 98th percentile of all historic precipitation events from 1961-1990.</span>-->

<span style="font-size:18px;">Precipitation events are measured under two different scenarios: High Greenhouse Gas Emission and Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions. These scenarios represent two different climate adaptation methods such as continuing to burn fossil fuels or using renewable energy sources.</span>-->
