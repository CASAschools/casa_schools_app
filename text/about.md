About 

Effective climate adaptation has to be grounded in an understanding of local vulnerabilities to climate hazards. To serve as community hubs for climate adaptation planning and activities, schools need information about the intersecting threats that climate change poses. 

This dashboard aims to be a resource for schools and communities across California providing localized climate hazard data. In this dashboard there is data for the 10,008 California public schools. In this dashboard the following climate hazards can be viewed:
 
- Projected Extreme Heat Days
- Projected Extreme Precipitation
- Wildfire Risk
- Flooding Risk
- Sea Level Rise

In addition this dashboard also provides a Hazard Summary Metric to allow users to view a composition of the 5 hazards their community can be concerned about.
