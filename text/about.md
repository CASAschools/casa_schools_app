<span style="font-size:18px;"> The California Schools Climate Hazards
dashboard is intended as a resource for students and teachers to use as
a resource in the classroom and at home. By exploring climate hazards
locally, students and teachers can become empowered to make better
decisions for their communities.</span>

<span style="font-size:18px;"> The dashboard was created by a team of
graduate students at the Bren School of Environmental Science &
Management at UC Santa Barbara in 2024 as part of a pilot project funded by the National
Science Foundation, the Climate Adaptation Solutions Accelerator (CASA).
The GitHub repository for this dashboard can be found at the following
