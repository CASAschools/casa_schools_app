<span style="font-size:18px;"> The California Schools Climate Hazards
dashboard is intended as a resource for students and teachers to use as
a resource in the classroom and at home. By exploring climate hazards
locally, students and teachers can become empowered to make better
decisions for their communities.</span>

<span style="font-size:18px;"> The dashboard was created by a team of
graduate students at the Bren School of Environmental Science &
Management at UC Santa Barbara in 2024 as part of a pilot project funded by the National
Science Foundation, the Climate Adaptation Solutions Accelerator (CASA).
The GitHub repository for this dashboard can be found at the following

<span style="font-size:18px;">Kristina Glass is a recent graduate of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. Holding a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Studies, a Minor in Public Policy, and a Certificate in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) from Temple University, her interests are focused on the politics of the environment and how they impact global communities, explored through the lens of critical geography. Her data science interests are centered on developing accessible data visualizations to effectively communicate research with a broad audience, and in bringing clarity to data findings in scientific and academic writing and research. She hopes to use her education from Bren to increase the accessibility of science communication and to aid in her future educational pursuits, studying the socio-cultural interactions between humans and the environment.</span>
