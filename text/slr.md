### What does this map tell us?
<span style="font-size:18px;"> These maps show the extent of flooding during a modeled 100-year coastal storm with two different levels of sea level rise. The map on the left includes sea levels from 2000, while the map on the right includes .8 feet of sea level rise, which California is projected to reach by 2050. Note that while the maps show data from different times, the basemap and satellite imagery are current.</span>

### How is sea level rise measured?
<span style="font-size:18px;">Here, sea level rise includes permanent flooding due to increased sea levels as well as temporary flooding during a modeled 100-year coastal storm. A 100-year storm is a storm so strong that it only has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year, creating storm surges up to 4 meters high.

<span style="font-size:18px;">While sea level rise might be a slow process, the combined effects of increased sea levels and a 100-year coastal storm pose a flood hazard to coastal communities in California.</span>

<span style="font-size:18px;">Currently, sea level rise data from this source is only available for coastal areas south of Point Arena in Mendocino County. Coastal communities north of there still may experience the effects of sea level rise and a coastal storm.</span>
