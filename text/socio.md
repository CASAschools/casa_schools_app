Why socioeconomics? Climate change disproportionately impacts communities in California. Communities that have been historically underserved are more sensitive and can have fewer resources to protect themselves, recover, and adapt to the effects of climate change. For example, climate change affects the economy (ie., damage to property, health impacts) and limits financial capacity to adapt to climate change impacts. Thus, identifying the socioeconomic status of schools could provide a prediction of climate change vulnerability.
