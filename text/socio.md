## Why climate adaptation and schools?

<br>

<span style="font-size:18px;"> Disasters related to climate change are an intergenerational issue and can be disruptive schools. More frequent extreme weather events will increase the likelihood that schools will need to respond to climate-driven emergencies and public health issues. This also negatively affect student learning, school facilities, and district budgets.

<span style="font-size:18px;"> Additionally, climate change disproportionately impacts communities in California. Schools that serve more historically under resourced populations will likely also be more severely impacted. Thus, identifying the socioeconomic status of schools could provide a prediction of climate change vulnerability.</span>
