### What do these diagrams tell us?


<span style="font-size:18px;"> 
The hazards overview provides a summary of the individual hazards each school faces in relation to schools in the rest of the state. It serves as a jumping off point to dive deeper into specific hazards in the "Explore Your Hazards tab". </span>


### How was the hazards overview created?


<span style="font-size:18px;"> Each school receives a single number summary for each hazard. For extreme heat and extreme precipitation, these are the number of expected days of extreme heat and extreme precipitation between 2030 and 2035. For wildfire, this is the average wildfire hazard potential score. For flooding, this is the percentage of the school community area that falls within a high risk flood zone. For sea level rise, this is the percentage of the school community area affected by projected 2050 sea levels and a 100-year coastal storm. A score of 0 represents no risk based on the chosen dataset and timeframe. A score of 1-5 represents lower to higher risk. The total score is the sum of all of the individual hazard scores. </span>
