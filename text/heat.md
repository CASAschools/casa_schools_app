### What does this diagram tell us?


<span style="font-size:18px;"> The diagram shows the estimated number of extreme heat days the school may experience from 2006 - 2064 in a Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions (yellow) and High Greenhouse Gas Emissions (red) scenario. These scenarios represent two different climate adaptation methods, where under a reduced scenario, emissions may be eliminated through the use of renewable energy sources. Under a high scenario, fossil fuels will continue to be burned, contributing to greater greenhouse gas emissions.  </span>


### How is extreme heat measured?


<span style="font-size:18px;"> An extreme heat event is a day where maximum temperatures are above 98Â°F. This threshold was calculated by determining the temperature that was exceeded by 98% of all historic extreme heat events from 1961-1990. </span>
