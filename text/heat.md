### What does this graph tell us?


<span style="font-size:18px;"> This plot shows the estimated number of extreme heat days from 2006 to 2064 for a reduced emissions and high emissions scenario. </span>


### How is extreme heat measured?


<span style="font-size:18px;"> Extreme heat days are measured as maximum daily temperature above 98Â°F.This threshold was obtained by taking the 98th percentile of all historic precipitation events from 1961-1990. </span>


<span style="font-size:18px;">High greenhouse gas emission is a projection of future climate impacts assuming no efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emission is taken and continues to increase. Reduced greenhouse gas emission is a projection of future climate impacts assuming mitigation if there is a reduction and limit of emitted greenhouse concentration. </span>
