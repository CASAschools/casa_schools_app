### What does this graph tell us?
<span style="font-size:18px;"> This plot shows the estimated number of extreme heat days from 2005 to 2064 for two scenarios. </span>

### How is extreme heat measured?
<span style="font-size:18px;"> Extreme heat days are measured as maximum daily temperature above 98Â°F. High greenhouse gas emission is a projection of future climate impacts assuming no efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emission is taken and continues to increase. Reduced greenhouse gas emission is a projection of future climate impacts assuming mitigation if there is a reduction and limit of emitted greenhouse concentration. 

This data was obtained from Cal-Adapt LOCA Downscaled CMIP5 Climate Projections.</span>
