### What does this diagram tell us?


<span style="font-size:18px;">This map shows which flood risk zone that your school is in, which can range from "High" or "Moderate to Low" risk. Some areas may have "Undetermined" risk. </span>


### How is flood risk measured?


<span style="font-size:18px;">High flood hazard areas are labeled as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) on Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) maps and are measured as having a 1-percent annual chance of flood, also known as a 100-year flood. Moderate flood hazard areas are areas where flooding is reduced but not completely removed, also known as having a 0.2-percent annual chance of flood or 500-year flood. Low flood hazard areas have minimal flood hazard with areas outside the SFHA and are higher in elevation when compared to 0.2-percent annual chance of flood areas. </span>


<span style="font-size:18px;">Additionally, "Undetermined"" risk areas refer to areas on the FEMA maps where there are possible but undetermined, flood hazards or unstudied areas. All areas in the United States are considered to have some level of risk. </span>
