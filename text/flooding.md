### How is flood risk measured?

# <br>
# <span style="font-size:18px;">High flood hazard areas are labeled as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) on FEMA maps and are measured as having a 1-percent annual chance of flood, which are also referred to as the base flood or 100-year flood. Moderate flood hazard areas are areas between the limits of the base flood and the 0.2-percent-annual-chance (or 500-year) flood. Low flood hazard areas have minimal flood hazard with areas outside the SFHA and are higher in elevation when compared to 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood areas. Additionally, undetermined zoning categories refer to areas on the FEMA maps where there are possible but undetermined, flood hazards or unstudied areas. All areas in the United States are considered to have some level of risk.</span>
