### What does this map tell us?
<span style="font-size:18px;"> The map on the right shows which green areas in your community are susceptible to wildfire, and the map on the left shows the same data from 2012. Note that while the maps show data from different times, the basemap and satellite imagery are current.</span>

### How is wildfire hazard potential measured?
<span style="font-size:18px;">Wildfire hazard potential describes the likelihood of wildfire based on past fire occurrences, weather conditions and patterns, and the types of vegetation present. Each square measures 270 meters by 270 meters and falls into the categories of very low, low, moderate, high, and very high.

<span style="font-size:18px;">Wildfire hazard potential only describes areas covered by majority vegetation, where wildfires may start. While wildfires can affect developed areas as well, they are treated as a separate category in the data.</span>

These maps use the United States Forest Service's Wildfire Hazard Potential for the United States, but are not endorsed by the USFS. <br>
