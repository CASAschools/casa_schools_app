### What does this map tell us?


<span style="font-size:18px;">The map on the right shows whether wildland vegetation in your community is susceptible to wildfire. The map on the left shows historical data from 2012 of wildfire risk for the same area. Note that while the maps show data from different timeframes, the basemap and satellite imagery shown are current.</span>


### How is wildfire hazard potential measured?


<span style="font-size:18px;">Wildfire hazard potential describes the likelihood of wildfire based on past fire occurrences, weather conditions and patterns, and the types of vegetation present. Each square measures 270 meters by 270 meters and falls into the categories of very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. </span>


<span style="font-size:18px;">A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire that burns in wildland vegetation, often in rural areas. While wildfires can affect developed areas as well, they are treated as a separate category in the data. </span>
